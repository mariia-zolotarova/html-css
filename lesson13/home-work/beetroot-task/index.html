            <p class="text chapter-2__text">React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS
                applications using React and the app platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript
                to access your platform‚Äôs APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React
                components: bundles of reusable, nestable code. You can learn more about React in the next section. But
                first, let‚Äôs cover how components work in React Native.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="text chapter-3__text">React Native runs on React, a popular open source library for building user
                interfaces with JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This
                section can get you started or can serve as a refresher course. </p>
            <p class="text chapter-3__text">We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
            <p class="text chapter-3__text">+ components. The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its
                examples: friendly, approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in. </p>
            <p class="text chapter-3__text">+ JSX. React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements
                inside JavaScript like so: <Text>Hello, I am your cat!</Text>.</p>
            <p class="text chapter-3__text">The React docs have a comprehensive guide to JSX you can refer to learn even
                more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a name for the
                cat, name, and embedding it with curly braces inside <Text></p>
            <p class="text chapter-3__text">+ props. Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù. </p>
            <p class="text chapter-3__text">+ state. While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how
                components render, state is like a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data
                that changes over time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!</p>

            <p class="text chapter-4__text">TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an
                onChangeText prop that takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing
                prop that takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.</p>
            <p class="text chapter-4__text">For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their
                words into a different language. In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So
                the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".</p>
